# Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Potential Calculations
iPython Notebook showing calculation of the change in surface potential due to added surface charge (e.g. biomolecule) using Poisson-Boltzmann-based models
SurfaceChargeCalculations.ipynb can be downloaded and interactively run in Juypter Notebook viewer, or viewed online directly. 
Contains:
-Analytical Solutions to linearised and non-linearised Poisson-Boltzmann Equation
-Numerical Solutions to Poisson-Boltzmann Equation for mixed valence electrolyte e.g. Phosphate-Buffered Saline
-Numerical Solution to the Modified Poisson Boltzmann Equation
